# db/setup_db.py

## Purpose

Database connection and session management for the Discord message indexer. This module provides centralized database connectivity and session management through context managers, ensuring proper resource handling and clean separation of database concerns from application logic.

## Key Components

### Database Session Management

**get_db() Context Manager**
- Provides database sessions through Python context manager pattern
- Ensures automatic session cleanup after use
- Handles database connection lifecycle management
- Returns database session object for use in storage operations

### Design Philosophy

This module implements the principle of separation of concerns by:
- Isolating all database connectivity logic in dedicated module
- Providing reusable session management across the entire application
- Removing database connection responsibilities from business logic modules
- Enabling easy database implementation swapping without affecting other modules

## Context Manager Pattern

### Usage Example
```python
from db import get_db

with get_db() as session:
    # Perform database operations
    store_message_data(session, data)
    store_embeddings(session, message_id, embeddings)
    # Session automatically closed
```

### Benefits
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Sessions are automatically created and closed
- **Exception Safety**: Sessions are properly closed even if exceptions occur
- **Clean Code**: No manual session management in calling code
- **Reusability**: Same session management pattern used throughout application

## Current Implementation Status

**Architecture:** Fully implemented with proper context manager pattern
**Session Management:** Fully implemented with automatic cleanup
**Resource Handling:** Implemented with proper exception safety
**Module Separation:** Fully implemented with clean separation of concerns

### Skeleton Implementation
- Returns mock session dictionary for testing and development
- Logs session creation and cleanup operations
- Simulates database connectivity behavior
- Provides proper context manager interface

### Mock Session Structure
```python
{
    "connected": True,
    "session_id": "mock_session"
}
```

## Integration Points

### Used By
- `message_processing/storage.py` - Imports `get_db` for all database operations
- Any future modules requiring database access
- Database-dependent operations throughout the application

### Database Independence
- Storage modules import session management, not specific database implementations
- Business logic modules remain database-agnostic
- Easy transition to real database implementations

## Future Implementation

Ready for real database integration:

### ChromaDB Integration
- Vector database for embedding storage and similarity search
- Document storage for message content and metadata
- Collection management for organized data storage

### PostgreSQL Integration (if needed)
- Relational data for complex queries and relationships
- Structured metadata storage
- User and channel relationship tracking

### Session Management Features
- Connection pooling for performance optimization
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Retry logic for connection reliability
- Health checking and connection validation

## Architecture Benefits

- **Centralized Database Logic**: All database concerns in single module
- **Clean Dependencies**: Clear separation between database and application logic
- **Easy Testing**: Mock sessions enable comprehensive testing without database
- **Flexible Implementation**: Can switch database backends without changing calling code
- **Resource Safety**: Guaranteed session cleanup prevents resource leaks
