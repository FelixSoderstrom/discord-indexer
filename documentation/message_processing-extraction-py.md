# message_processing/extraction.py

## Purpose

Link and content extraction functionality for Discord messages. Handles extraction and processing of URLs, mentions, attachments, and other structured content from Discord messages to enhance searchability and context understanding.

## Key Functions

### URL Processing

**extract_urls(message_content)**
- Extracts URLs from Discord message text using regex patterns
- Handles HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Returns list of extracted URLs for further processing
- Supports various URL formats and structures

**analyze_link_content(url)**
- Analyzes URLs and extracts metadata from linked content
- Processes webpage titles, descriptions, and content types
- Determines content accessibility and relevance
- Returns structured metadata for enhanced search context

### Mention Processing

**extract_mentions(message_content)**
- Extracts Discord-specific mentions from message text
- Processes user mentions (format: `<@user_id>`)
- Processes channel mentions (format: `<#channel_id>`)
- Returns structured mention data with user and channel ID separation

### Processing Coordination

**process_message_extractions(message_data)**
- Main entry point for extraction processing
- Coordinates URL extraction, mention processing, and link analysis
- Processes complete message data from Discord extraction
- Returns comprehensive extraction results with metadata tracking

## Output Structure

### Extraction Results Format
```python
{
    'urls': [str],
    'mentions': {
        'user_mentions': [str],
        'channel_mentions': [str]
    },
    'link_metadata': [
        {
            'url': str,
            'domain': str,
            'title': str,
            'description': str,
            'content_type': str,
            'accessible': bool
        }
    ],
    'extraction_metadata': {
        'urls_found': int,
        'mentions_found': int,
        'links_analyzed': int
    }
}
```

## Current Implementation Status

**Architecture:** Fully implemented with proper data flow
**URL Extraction:** Basic regex implementation functional
**Mention Extraction:** Discord ID pattern extraction functional
**Link Analysis:** Skeleton implementation with placeholder metadata
**Processing Coordination:** Fully implemented with comprehensive tracking

### Skeleton Behavior
- URL extraction uses basic HTTP/HTTPS regex patterns
- Mention extraction uses Discord ID patterns (`<@!?(\d+)>`, `<#(\d+)>`)
- Link analysis returns placeholder metadata structures
- All processing logic and metadata tracking is functional

## Integration

### Input Sources
- Receives processed message data from pipeline coordinator
- Handles Discord message content text analysis
- Processes mentions and URLs from message extraction

### Output Destinations
- Extraction results passed to storage coordination
- URL metadata prepared for enhanced search context
- Mention data tracked for user and channel relationship mapping

## Future Implementation

Ready for advanced extraction capabilities:
- Advanced URL content scraping and analysis
- Rich media detection and metadata extraction
- Social media link preview generation
- Enhanced mention context and relationship tracking
- Content type detection and specialized handling
- Rate limiting and respectful web scraping practices
